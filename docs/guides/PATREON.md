# How to access Patreon links!
Welcome to this amazing guide :) 

## Step 1
**Become a patron...**

*To follow this tutorial, you must be a patron, duh.*


## Step 2
Find a supporter link in Patreon. Posts with links will have the `New links` tag, so just search for that.
Some links are experimental and may not work as intended, but we will always tell you if it's experimental.
## Step 3

Use the password from the Patreon post *Same post you got the link from, duh*
## Step 4

Enter the password and Start using Nebula
## Troubleshooting 

If the password is incorrect: 
- Make sure you entered the correct password
- Check the latest Patreon post to see if it changed *-- Only happens in emergencies, like password leaking*
- If none of those work, then and only then contact chloe@nebula.bio or GreenWorld#0001 on discord.
